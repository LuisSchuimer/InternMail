# X-Mail
X-Mail is an email system that anyone can set up their own email server. It's safe, free, and easy to use. Every time an email is sent through the X-Mail system, it is encrypted. You can also display Google emails in your X-Mail mailbox.

We hope that there will be a large community on X-Mail, so we have added a feature that lets you set up a status to let other people know if you are currently online. The system does not need much computing power to run well; however, it's still important to keep the bandwidth usage low. Emails always run on community servers. Modify the Python code as you wishâ€”it's open source!
